This skill will not work without one. To get a signup link, you can say \"Alexa, ask adjust the bed to sign up\". Use that link and either your SleepIQ user/pass or your adjustTheBedPassProxy (https://github.com/tuctboh/adjustTheBedPassProxy) during the signup.\n\nIf you make a mistake entering either, please use \"Alexa, ask adjust the bed to reset my information\" and then you can say \"Alexa, ask adjust the bed to sign up\".\n\nThis is just the beginning, we plan to add the ability to adjust the head and feet too!",
